## Background 
In this project, our task is to construct an engaging interactive dashboard for a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset provides insights into the microorganisms inhabiting human navels, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study.

As the data unfolds, it reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. Our objective is to craft a dashboard that allows users to  explore and visualize these microbial communities, provide a deeper understanding of the fascinating biodiversity within our belly buttons.
